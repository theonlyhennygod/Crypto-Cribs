## 🔧 Developer Testing

### Network Monitoring
```typescript
// Check network status
const xrpl = useXRPL()
const ftso = useFTSO() 
const fdc = useFDC()

console.log('XRPL Connected:', xrpl.isConnected)
console.log('FTSO Data:', ftso.getAllPrices())
console.log('FDC Status:', fdc.isConnected)
```

### Price Feed Testing
```typescript
// Test FTSOv2 integration
const xrpPrice = ftso.getXRPPrice()      // Current XRP/USD
const flrPrice = ftso.getFLRPrice()      // Current FLR/USD
const rate = ftso.getXRPtoFLRRate()      // XRP to FLR conversion

console.log(`1 XRP = ${rate.rate} FLR`)
```

### Transaction Verification
```typescript
// Verify XRPL transaction
const txHash = "YOUR_TX_HASH"
const isValid = await xrpl.verifyTransaction(txHash)

// Submit for FDC attestation  
await fdc.submitAttestationRequest(txHash, fromAddr, toAddr, amount)
```
